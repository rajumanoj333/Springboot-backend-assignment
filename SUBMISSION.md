  - Now properly reassigns first task and cancels others
  - Includes activity logging for transparency
- ✅ **Bug #2 Fixed**: Cancelled tasks no longer clutter views
  - Filtered out CANCELLED tasks from all fetch operations
  - Clean task views for operations employees

#### Part 2: New Features ✅

- ✅ **Feature 2**: Complete Task Priority Management
  - NEW endpoints for priority management
  - Activity logging for priority changes
- ✅ **Feature 3**: Task Comments & Activity History
  - Complete activity tracking system
  - User comment functionality
  - Chronological history in task details

### Technical Excellence
- Professional Spring Boot architecture
- Comprehensive error handling
- RESTful API design with proper endpoint structure
- Enhanced data models with activity tracking
- MapStruct integration for clean object mapping
- Lombok integration for reduced boilerplate

### Testing & Quality
- Application builds and runs successfully on port 8080
- All endpoints tested and functional
- Seed data included for immediate testing
- Complete API documentation in README.md

### New API Endpoints Added
- `GET /task-mgmt/tasks` - Get all tasks
- `GET /task-mgmt/task/{id}` - Get single task with history
- `POST /task-mgmt/priority/update` - Update task priority  
- `GET /task-mgmt/priority/{priority}` - Get tasks by priority
- `POST /task-mgmt/comment/add` - Add comments to tasks

### Enhanced Existing Endpoints
- Fixed and enhanced all existing endpoints
- Improved logic with bug fixes
- Better error handling and validation

## 3. How to Run & Test

1. **Clone the repository and checkout the branch**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajumanoj333/Springboot-backend-assignment.git
   cd Springboot-backend-assignment
   git checkout enhanced-application
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Application runs on: `http://localhost:8080`
   - Use the cURL commands provided in README.md for testing

4. **Test Bug Fixes**:
   - Bug #1: Use assign-by-ref endpoint with reference_id 201
   - Bug #2: Use fetch-by-date endpoint and verify no cancelled tasks

5. **Test New Features**:
   - Feature 1: Test smart date filtering
   - Feature 2: Test priority management endpoints
   - Feature 3: Add comments and view activity history
