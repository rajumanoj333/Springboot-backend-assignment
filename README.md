# Workforce Management - Enhanced Spring Boot Application

This is a fully functional Spring Boot application for the Backend Engineer assignment with all bug fixes and new features implemented.

## Project Structure

The project has been properly structured according to Spring Boot best practices:

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following packages:

*   `controller`: Contains the API endpoints that handle incoming requests.
*   `service`: Holds the business logic of the application.
*   `model`: Defines the data structures (e.g., `TaskManagement`, `Priority`).
*   `dto`: (Data Transfer Objects) are used to shape the data for API responses.
*   `repository`: Manages the in-memory data store.

## Code Changes and Features

Here's a breakdown of the key features and the code that powers them:

### 1. Bug Fix: Task Re-assignment

*   **The Problem:** When a task was reassigned, the old task remained, creating a duplicate.
*   **The Fix:** The `assignByReference` method in `TaskManagementServiceImpl.java` has been updated to mark the old task as `CANCELLED`.

    ```java
    // In TaskManagementServiceImpl.java

    // Find the existing task
    List<TaskManagement> existingTasks = taskRepository.findByReferenceIdAndReferenceType(request.getReferenceId(), request.getReferenceType());

    // Cancel the old task
    for (TaskManagement task : existingTasks) {
        task.setStatus(TaskStatus.CANCELLED);
        taskRepository.save(task);
    }

    // Create a new task for the new assignee
    // ...
    ```

### 2. Bug Fix: Filtering Cancelled Tasks

*   **The Problem:** The API was returning cancelled tasks, cluttering the task list.
*   **The Fix:** The `fetchTasksByDate` method in `TaskManagementServiceImpl.java` now filters out cancelled tasks.

    ```java
    // In TaskManagementServiceImpl.java

    public List<TaskManagementDto> fetchTasksByDate(TaskFetchByDateRequest request) {
        List<TaskManagement> tasks = taskRepository.findByAssigneeIdIn(request.getAssigneeIds());

        List<TaskManagement> filteredTasks = tasks.stream()
                .filter(task -> task.getStatus() != TaskStatus.CANCELLED) // Filter out cancelled tasks
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

        return taskMapper.modelListToDtoList(filteredTasks);
    }
    ```

### 3. New Feature: Task Priority

*   **What's New:** You can now set a priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW) for each task.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   The `TaskManagement` model now has a `priority` field.
    *   A new endpoint `/task-mgmt/priority/{priority}` allows you to fetch all tasks of a specific priority.

### 4. New Feature: Comments and Activity History

*   **What's New:** You can now add comments to tasks and view a complete history of changes.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   The `Activity` and `Comment` models have been added to store this information.
    *   When you fetch a single task, the API response now includes its activity history and comments.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java 17 and Gradle installed.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (IntelliJ, VSCode, etc.).
3. Run the main class `com.railse.hiring.workforcemgmt.Application`.
4. The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

Alternative command line approach:
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Bug Fixes Implemented

### Bug Fix #1: Task Re-assignment Creates Duplicates ✅
**Issue**: When reassigning a task using 'assign-by-ref', old tasks weren't being cancelled, creating duplicates.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `assignByReference` method to:
- Reassign only the first matching task to the new assignee
- Mark all other duplicate tasks as CANCELLED
- Log activity history for both reassignment and cancellation

**Location**: `TaskManagementServiceImpl.assignByReference()`

### Bug Fix #2: Cancelled Tasks Clutter the View ✅
**Issue**: Cancelled tasks were being returned in task fetch operations.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `fetchTasksByDate` method to:
- Filter out tasks with status CANCELLED
- Only return active tasks (ASSIGNED, STARTED, COMPLETED)

**Location**: `TaskManagementServiceImpl.fetchTasksByDate()`

## New Features Implemented

### Feature 1: Smart Daily Task View ✅
**Enhancement**: The date-based task fetching now provides a true "today's work" view.

**Implementation**: 
- Returns all active tasks that started within the date range
- PLUS all active tasks that started before the range but are still open (not completed)

**Benefits**: Operations employees now see everything they need to act on, not just tasks created today.

### Feature 2: Task Priority Management ✅
**New Endpoints**:
- `GET /task-mgmt/priority/{priority}` - Fetch tasks by priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- `POST /task-mgmt/priority/update` - Update task priority

**Features**:
- Priority field added to TaskManagement model
- Automatic activity logging when priority changes
- Manager can set and change task priorities

### Feature 3: Task Comments  Activity History ✅
**New Endpoint**:
- `POST /task-mgmt/comment/add` - Add comments to tasks

**Features**:
- **Activity History**: Automatically logs key events (task creation, status changes, priority updates, reassignments)
- **User Comments**: Users can add free-text comments to tasks
- **Complete History**: When fetching task details, the API returns complete activity history and comments, sorted chronologically

## Technical Implementation Details

### Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java 17
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.0.4
- **Build Tool**: Gradle
- **Database**: In-memory Java collections (as required)
- **Additional Libraries**:
  - Lombok (for reducing boilerplate code)
  - MapStruct (for object mapping)
  - Spring Web

### Key Enhancements Made

1. **Activity Tracking**: Every task automatically tracks its history including creation, status changes, priority updates, and reassignments.

2. **Smart Date Filtering**: The enhanced `fetchTasksByDate` now implements true "daily work view" logic showing both new tasks and ongoing work.

3. **Priority Management**: Complete priority system with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW levels and update tracking.

4. **Comment System**: Users can add contextual comments to tasks for better collaboration.

5. **Bug Fixes**: Both reported bugs have been completely resolved with proper testing.

### Data Model Enhancements

- **TaskManagement**: Now includes `createdAt`, `activities`, and `comments` fields
- **Activity**: Tracks all significant task events with timestamps
- **Comment**: Stores user comments with timestamps
- **Priority**: New enum for task prioritization

### Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling with:
- Custom exception classes
- Global exception handler
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages

## Testing the Application

1. **Start the application**: Run `./gradlew bootRun`
2. **Test Bug Fix #1**: Use the assign-by-ref endpoint with reference_id 201 (has duplicates in seed data)
3. **Test Bug Fix #2**: Use fetch-by-date endpoint and verify cancelled tasks are excluded
4. **Test Feature 1**: Create tasks with different creation dates and verify smart filtering
5. **Test Feature 2**: Update task priorities and fetch by priority
6. **Test Feature 3**: Add comments and verify they appear in task details

## Sample Response Format

All responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "data": {...},
  "pagination": null,
  "status": {
    "code": 200,
    "message": "Success"
  }
```

Task details now include full activity history and comments:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "reference_id": 101,
    "reference_type": "ORDER",
    "task": "CREATE_INVOICE",
    "description": "Invoice creation task",
    "status": "ASSIGNED",
    "assignee_id": 1,
    "task_deadline_time": 1728192000000,
    "priority": "HIGH",
